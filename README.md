## Introduction 📖
This repository hosts the Dockerfiles and necessary configurations for the unofficial [GetGrass](https://app.getgrass.io/register/?referralCode=qyvJmxgNUhcLo2f) Docker images for grass lite, grass node and grass desktop flavors. It's designed to facilitate the deployment of Grass (GetGrass) in Docker environments, supporting both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.

## Features ✨
- **Debian slim Base Image**: Utilizes the latest version of Debian slim for a small footprint.
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Supports both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.
- **Minimal Configuration**: Easy to set up with minimal configuration required.
- **Auto-Update**: Always updated to be in line with the latest Grass version.
- **VNC Enabled**: Includes a VNC-based graphical interface to check and optionally interact with Grass.

## Prerequisites 📋
Ensure Docker is installed on your system. For installation instructions, please refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Quick Start 🚀
You can run it easily passing the appropriate environment variables.
- ### Docker cli 🐳
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name grass -h my_device -e GRASS_USER=your_email -e GRASS_PASS=your_password mrcolorrain/grass
  ```
- ### Docker compose 🐳
  ```yaml
  version: "3.9"
  services:
    grass:
      container_name: grass
      hostname: my_device
      image: mrcolorrain/grass
      environment:
        - GRASS_USER=your_email
        - GRASS_PASS=your_password
      restart: unless-stopped
  ```
---
## Grass-Node 📦
This section provides instructions on how to use the grass-node extension if you want to use this instead of the standard grass extension available in the other image.
- ### Docker cli 🐳
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name grass-node -h my_device -e USER_EMAIL=your_email -e USER_PASSWORD=your_password -p 5900:5900 -p 6080:6080 mrcolorrain/grass-node
  ```
- ### Docker compose 🐳
  ```yaml
  version: "3.9"
  services:
    grass-node:
      container_name: grass-node
      hostname: my_device
      image: mrcolorrain/grass-node
      environment:
        USER_EMAIL: your_email
        USER_PASSWORD: your_password
      ports:
        - "5900:5900"
        - "6080:6080"
  ```
   _Default vnc password is the default password of [vnc-browser](https://github.com/MRColorR/vnc-browser) image. (Currently it should be: `money4band`)_

## Grass-Desktop 🖥️
we have also a Grass Desktop image available. This section provides instructions on how to use the grass-desktop GUI application fully automated inside a container.  Just in case you want to use this instead of the standard grass-node or grass extension available in the other images. 
_Note: This GUI version is heavier than the other images due to the additional components required to run a full desktop environment._
- ### Docker cli 🐳
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name grass-desktop -h my_device -e USER_EMAIL=your_email -e USER_PASSWORD=your_password -p 5900:5900 -p 6080:6080 mrcolorrain/grass-desktop
  ```
- ### Docker compose 🐳
  ```yaml
  version: "3.9"
  services:
    grass-desktop:
      container_name: grass-desktop
      hostname: my_device
      image: mrcolorrain/grass-desktop
      environment:
        USER_EMAIL: your_email
        USER_PASSWORD: your_password
      ports:
        - "5900:5900"
        - "6080:6080"
  ```
